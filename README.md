# Installation
    sudo gem install codes

# Why?

`codes` can help you automate sending promo codes to journalists and create promo codes for tons of apps with the press of a button.

# Usage

    code [num] [-a app_identifier] [-u user_name] [-i app_id] [-o output_file]

All parameters are optional.

`code` will print out the promo codes and store them in a file called `codes_[your app identifier].txt` in the current directory by default.

Example:

    code 3 -a com.example.myApp

Will generate 3 promo codes for the the App with the Bundle Identifier `com.example.myApp`. 

If you don't pass any paramaters, `code` will generate a single promo code and print it on the command line.

# Considerations
As part of the process of downloading promo codes from iTunes Connect, the user would normally have to accept a contract every single time. Since there is no way to check with iTunes if this contract was accepted manually before, `codes` agrees to this contract automatically. Before using `codes` for the first time, we advise you to go to iTunes Connect and go through the process of creating promo codes manually at least once and to read the contract when it comes up.
