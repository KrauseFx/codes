# Installation
    sudo gem install codes

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Why?

`codes` can help you automate sending promo codes to journalists and create promo codes for tons of apps with the press of a button.

# Usage

    codes [num] [-a app_identifier] [-u user_name] [-i app_id] [-o output_file] [-c country] [-X] [-f format]

All parameters are optional.

`codes` will print out the promo codes and store them in a file called `codes_[your app identifier].txt` in the current directory by default.

Example:

    codes 3 -a com.example.myApp

Will generate 3 promo codes for the the App with the Bundle Identifier `com.example.myApp`. 

If you don't pass any paramaters, `codes` will generate a single promo code and print it on the command line.

## Display extra information

Use the ```--format FORMAT``` argument to control the displayed information. The ```--verbose``` argument displays all information and maps to

    --format '%c,%d,%p,%i,%b,%n,%u'

E.g.

    codes --verbose

will display

    NRTFXP3XXXXX,20150520110716,ios,522069155,com.wewanttoknow.DragonBoxPlus,'DragonBox Algebra 5+',https://buy.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/redeemLandingPage?code=NRTFXP3XXXXX

For example, if you want a custom URL, you could use something like

    codes --format '%c: http://yoursite.com/redeem/%c'

## Generate URLs

    codes 5 --urls

If specified, includes a full URL for each code that can be used to redeem that code.

# Considerations
As part of the process of downloading promo codes from iTunes Connect, the user would normally have to accept a contract every single time. Since there is no way to check with iTunes if this contract was accepted manually before, `codes` agrees to this contract automatically. Before using `codes` for the first time, we advise you to go to iTunes Connect and go through the process of creating promo codes manually at least once and to read the contract when it comes up.
